Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Static method uses complie time binding or early binding.
A static method cannot be overridden being compile time binding. 
A static method is a method that belongs to a class, but it does not belong to an instance of that class and this method can be called without the instance or object of that class.	
In the static method, less memory is used for execution because memory allocation happens only once because the static keyword fixed a particular memory for that method in ram.
The static method cannot be overridden because of early binding.

Non-static method uses run time binding or dynamic binding. 
A non-static method can be overridden being dynamic binding.
Every method in java defaults to a non-static method without a static keyword preceding it. non-static methods can access any static method and static variable also, without using the object of the class.
In the non-static method, much memory is used for execution because here memory allocation happens when the method is invoked and the memory is allocated every time when the method is called. 
The non-static method can be overridden because of runtime binding.
